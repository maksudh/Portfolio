        <h1><a href="https://github.com/maksudh/weather-app">Weather App</a></h1>
        <div>
            <p>This weather app was made during my GUI module in University. The logic, code 
                and layout of the app was created by me and one other member of my group as we were the 
                appointed JavaScript developers. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="innerproject">
            <ol>
                <li>
                    This is the UI of our weather app, it has a minimal yet informative GUI where the user
                    can see all important weather information at a glance.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    The app background changes dynamically depending on the current weather or conditions.
                    For example: if its cloudy it will display clouds, if its clear it will display a clear blue sky.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A hourly notification will also pop up at the top of the app, this will show a small 
                    update on the current weather for the user to see, including the temperature, highs and
                    lows, chance of rain and a brief description of the conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    As you scroll down, more detailed information about the weather will be displayed. For example,
                    chances of precipitation, wind intensity etc. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Hourly weather predictions are also displayed with a ten day prediction also below including
                    highs and lows throughout the span of these days.

        <div>
            <p>The FDM login page was created in in my Software Engineering module to show how we could develop
                a full scale project utilising an agile design process.
                The front end JavaScript side was created by me, while the backend was created by my group partner.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    The FDM login was a proof of concept project we built to showcase out abilities in Software Engineering
                    with a team.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The portal contains a message page where you can send and receive messages from others using the 
                    portal. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In addition to this, there is a News forum where people using the portal can post relevant News
                    or updates that they'd like to share with other users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is an account and also directory page where you can view your details and also the 
                    profiles of other users on the portal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The login process has verification on the backend to check if a user has admin privileges or not before
                    entering to make sure the correct pages are displayed.
